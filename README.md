# WebRTC Demonstrations
## Quick presentation

Made for the IV Evolux Academy.
It quickly shows some possibilities with WebRTC API.

Accordingly
[with MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)
(although I may not entirely agree):

> WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) is a technology which enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

It runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
